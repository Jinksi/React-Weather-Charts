# React Weather Charts

A tiny app that charts a 5-day temperature, pressure &amp; humidity forecast, based on user input.

I created this while following the **Modern React with Redux** course by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider).

Built using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [React-Sparklines](https://github.com/borisyankov/react-sparklines) &amp; [React-Google-Maps](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps).

Weather data from [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org).
